Android MUD
=============
This is just a simple text-based (with some GUI) Android RPG game. Currently very little has been done and the path to a complete release is a long way off.

Path to 1.0 Release
------------------
* Add functioning item inventory
* Add functioning spell inventory
* Equipment inventory
* Item weight
* Spell learning mechanism
* Event flags
* World map + back tracking system
* Multiple characters (NPC fighters or perhaps even playable)
* Create a story
* Towns system with a town activity (many choices -> different menus)
* Inn activity
* Shop activity (not just a popup)
* Smith activity
* Inventory activity (not just a popup)
* Regular attack flags (from equipment)
* More robust level up / stats system (can choose bonuses?)
